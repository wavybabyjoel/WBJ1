    <img src="Ezreal.png" width="400">
    <p><b>A dashing adventurer</b>, unknowingly gifted in the magical arts, Ezreal raids long-lost catacombs, tangles with ancient curses, and overcomes seemingly impossible odds with ease.</p> <p>His courage and bravado knowing no bounds, he prefers to improvise his way out of any situation, relying partially on his wits, but mostly on his mystical Shuriman gauntlet, which he uses to unleash devastating arcane blasts.</p> <p>One thing is for sureâ€”whenever Ezreal is around, trouble isn't too far behind. Or ahead. Probably everywhere.</p>
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <img src="Ez skills.png" width="400">
    <p><strong>Passive - RISING SPELL FORCE</strong></p>
    <p>Ezreal gains increasing Attack Speed each time he successfully hits a spell, stacking up to 5 times.</p>
    <img src="EZ - Q.png" width="125">
    <p><strong>Q - MYSTIC SHOT</strong></p>
    <p>Ezreal fires a damaging bolt of energy which reduces all of his cooldowns slightly if it strikes an enemy unit.</p>
    <img src="EZ - W.png" width="125">
    <p><strong>W - ESSENCE FLUX</strong></p>
    <p>Ezreal fires an orb that sticks to the first champion or objective hit. If Ezreal hits an enemy with the orb, it detonates and deals damage.</p>
    <img src="EZ - E.png" width="100">
    <p><strong>E - ARCANE SHIFT</strong></p>
    <p>Ezreal teleports to a target nearby location and fires a homing bolt which strikes the nearest enemy unit. Prioritizes enemies stuck with Essence Flux.</p>
    <img src="EZ - R.png" width="125">
    <p><strong>R - TRUESHOT BARRAGE</strong></p>
    <p>Ezreal winds up before firing a powerful barrage of energy that deals massive damage to each unit it passes through (damage is reduced for minions and non-epic monsters).</p>
